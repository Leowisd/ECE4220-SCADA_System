/* Lab6_cdev_kmod.c
 * ECE4220/7220
 * Based on code from: https://github.com/blue119/kernel_user_space_interfaces_example/blob/master/cdev.c
 * Modified and commented by: Luis Alberto Rivera

 You can compile the module using the Makefile provided. Just add
 obj-m += Lab6_cdev_kmod.o

 This Kernel module prints its "MajorNumber" to the system log. The "MinorNumber"
 can be chosen to be 0.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Broadly speaking: The Major Number refers to a type of device/driver, and the
 Minor Number specifies a particular device of that type or sometimes the operation
 mode of that device type. On a terminal, try:
    ls -l /dev/
 You'll see a list of devices, with two numbers (among other pieces of info). For
 example, you'll see tty0, tty1, etc., which represent the terminals. All those have
 the same Major number, but they will have different Minor numbers: 0, 1, etc.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 After installing the module,

 1) Check the MajorNumber using dmesg

 2) You can then create a Character device using the MajorNumber returned:
	  sudo mknod /dev/YourDevName c MajorNumber 0
    You need to create the device every time the Pi is rebooted.

 3) Change writing permissions, so that everybody can write to the Character Device:
	  sudo chmod go+w /dev/YourDevName
    Reading permissions should be enabled by default. You can check using
      ls -l /dev/YourDevName
    You should see: crw-rw-rw-

 After the steps above, you will be able to use the Character Device.
 If you uninstall your module, you won't be able to access your Character Device.
 If you install it again (without having shutdown the Pi), you don't need to
 create the device again --steps 2 and 3--, unless you manually delete it.

 Note: In this implementation, there is no buffer associated to writing to the
 Character Device. Every new string written to it will overwrite the previous one.
